# PyLab
Useful Python examples, e.g. plots
Initially created in 2023 but was removed from GitHub a couple of times and restarted from scratch a couplt of times
Please make sure you don't have the PyLab of matplotlib installed, which seemingly is now deappreciated
cosmo_tools.py and PyLab.py contains some useful functions, to use them from any locations, add this to your bash_profile:
export PYTHONPATH=Current_Path:${PYTHONPATH}
